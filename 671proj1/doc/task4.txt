COSC 671.101

Project 1
Task 4

It took me a little time to figure out C.  I haven't worked with C code in a while.  
It was a bit difficult to figure out what the variables in the C code were used for.  
The lack of documentation and poor formatting of the code made it harder to read.  
I renamed some of the methods as well.  It helps to use obvious or descriptive names.  
Especially in code with little comments.  

I added an additional character for '\r' to the array of characters for deletion.  
I was stuck on that for a while.  I forgot about '\r'.  Using JAutodoc made 
commenting a little easier.  Documentation takes a little longer, but overall 
it's worth it.  It makes your code more readable so others that
read your code long after you're gone understand what your code is doing.  

Maintenance is such an important part of software development.  You would think 
that taking the time to document changes to the project would be of the utmost 
priority but sadly that isn't always the case.  A tight schedule and customers 
demanding more new features often gets in the way.
