Project 1
Task 1

I elected to install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.  Installation was
pretty fast and easy.  Installing the Subclipse and JAutodoc plugins was
also easy, and I don't install a lot of these.  I'm usually restricted to
whatever has been pre-installed on my machine at work and any new plugins 
or packages need to be brought in by one of our Systems Administrators. 
For the Hello World program, I just wrote my own few lines of code and 
ran it as a Java Application through Eclipse.  

I like the JAutoDoc plugin. The right click "Add Javadoc" makes it so easy. 
It's also good for adding comments to methods that are frequently used 
like getters and setters. To kind of fill in the blanks making sure that 
all methods are documented equally so you have a nice complete API for 
other developers and the customer.
