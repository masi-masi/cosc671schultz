A description (2-3 paragraphs) of what you learned from this project and how it relates to some of
the topics covered in lecture:

I though this was an interesting project.  Since I didn't work with a partner I learned a 
little about maintenance.  I had never used the Google Web Toolkit before, so I had to learn
a little bit about its components and how to migrate my code from Project 1 to it.  It was 
pretty easy to use mostly because everything was well documented.  It was also a good exercise 
in changing the input and output and of a component without changing its overall functionality.

Had I worked with a partner it would have been a good exercise in working with Subversion.

A brief description (1-2 paragraphs) of what was the hardest part about this project:

I also had to take some time to read the GWT API and other documentation which 
slowed me down a little bit.

A brief description (1-2 paragraphs) how you changed your original code to accommodate it into

Moved methods from my Project 1 code to GreetingServiceImpl.java.
Modified the stutter functions to store the output to a StringBuffer for return.
Modified Stutter_Web_App.java to not submit when hitting "enter" key.

meets the requirements:
