Task 2
    To correct the JUnit Test failure: java.lang.AssertionError: 0 expected: <0> but was <1>
                                       at FibonacciTest.testFib(FibonacciTest.java:10)
    I corrected the case 0 in the switch statement in Fibonacci.fib(Fibonacci.java:4).  The 
    Fibonacci value F(n) where n = 0 is F(0) = 0.  The case statement states, where n = 0, 
    return 1 which is incorrect.  So line 4 of Fibonacci.java was modified as follows:
        case 0: return 1;  
            becomes
        case 0: return 0;
