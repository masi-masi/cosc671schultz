Task 3
    To correct the JUnit Test failures: java.lang.AssertionError: expected: <10.0> but was <25.0>
                                        at RectangleTest.testGetArea(RectangleTest.java:17)
                                   and: java.lang.AssertionError: expected: <5.3852> but was: <7.0710678118654755>
                                        at RectangleTest.testGetDiagonal(RectangleTest.java:23)
    I corrected a line in the Point class.  Originally point x was being initialized with the 
    parameterized point y.  So line 5 of Point.java was modified as follows:
        this.x = y;
            becomes
        this.x = x;
        
    Modifications to Rectangle.java for readability:
        1.  Created new private variables width and height for Rectangle.
            Values for these variables are initialized in the constructor.

                private Point p1, p2;
                private Double width, height;
    
                Rectangle(Point p1, Point p2) {
                    this.p1 = p1;
                    this.p2 = p2;
        
                    width = (this.p2.x - this.p1.x);
                    height = (this.p2.y - this.p1.y);
                }

        2.  Simplify getArea() by creating a variable area to be returned by the method.
            area is initialized using private class variables width and height.
                
                public Double getArea() {
                    Double area = Math.abs(width * height);
                    return area;
                }   
                
        3.  Simplify getDiagonal() by creating a variable diagonal to be returned by the method.
            Also added x and y variables for computing the squares of the width and height respectively.
            x and y are initialized using private class variables width and height.
            diagonal is initialized using the computed values of x and y.        
        
                public Double getDiagonal() {
                    Double diagonal;
            
                    Double x = Math.pow(width, 2);
                    Double y = Math.pow(height, 2);
        
                    diagonal = Math.sqrt(x + y);

                    return diagonal;
                }
