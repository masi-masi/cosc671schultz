Project 1
Task 3

I learned how to start a new project on Google Code.  I had heard about Google 
Code Jam from a coworker, but didn't know that they offered free hosting.  I 
learned how to create a new project, give other members priviledges to my project.  
Additionally I used the SVN Repository Exploring perspective to add the check in/
check out site to my list of repositories.  Google Code is perfect for class 
projects.  It's a great idea.  The last class I took we used Subversion for 
our group project.  We didn't use Google Code to host it but CVSDude which is 
now codesion.com.
