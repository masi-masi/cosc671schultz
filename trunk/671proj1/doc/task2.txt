Project 1
Task 2

While I do use Subclipse at work, I had never used it to check out a 
repository before.  I had always checked everything out using the command 
line and then built a new Java Project in Eclipse from that folder.  I have 
used some of the other Subclipse functions like Compare With, Revert, 
Commit, Update on a regular basis at work.  So I was pretty familiar with 
them.  I use Compare With a lot when working very closely with my 
coworkers particularly when we're editing the same classes or methods.  
The SVN Repository Exploring perspective was completely new to me.  
I used to get frustrated browsing the package structure from the command 
line when looking for the latest branch or tag.  I was used to seeing it 
in a tree in Eclipse.  Now that I know that feature is there, I will 
definitely use it.
