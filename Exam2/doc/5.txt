Define 10 mutants for the checkStutter method using the effective mutation 
operators given in Chapter 5.  Try to use each operator at least once.  
For each mutation, given a brief description.  Approximately how many 
mutants for the checkStutter method if we generated all from the effective
mutation operators?

ABS 34: lineNumber = abs(lineNumber + 1)
           Add absolute value operation
AOR 34: lineNumber = lineNumber - 1
           Decrement instead of increment
ROR 22: i > (words.length - 1)
           Greater than instead of less than
    22: i <= (words.length - 1)
           Less than equal to instead of less than
    22: i = (words.length - 1)
           Equals instead of less than
    22: i != (words.length - 1)
           Not equals instead of less than
    22: i >= (words.length - 1)
           Greater than equal to instead of less than
    25: words[i] != words[i+1]
           Not equals instead of equals
ASR 34: lineNumber = lineNumber / 1
           Divide lineNumber by 1 instead of adding 1
UOD 34: lineNumber = lineNumber * 1
           Multiply lineNumber by 1 instead of adding 1
           
Using all effective mutation operations there are about 39 possible mutations available.
